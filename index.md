# Mahmood Taghavi homepage at GitHub

I am a biostatistician with interests in statistics, epidemiology, and computer science. Please feel free to visit [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahmood-taghavi-03836940/) for general information about me or see my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=plLILOAAAAAJ) for the full list of my scientific publications.
However, this page is dedicated to my open source projects (scientific projects and also assistive technologies that I developed in my spare time) which were written in R, R Shiny, Matlab, Python, and C# dot Net programming languages.  

## Scientific projects

  - [Ridit](https://github.com/Mahmood-Taghavi/Ridit) is a package for Ridit analysis in **R** statistical environment. It is also available from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Ridit) (The Comprehensive R Archive Network). 
  - [FLUR](https://github.com/Mahmood-Taghavi/FLUR) is an interactive **R Shiny** web app that is designed to present the result of a functional regression model for spatial prediction of airborne particulate matter diurnal variation curves in the mega-city of Tehran. 
  - [d-stem-LUR](https://github.com/Mahmood-Taghavi/d-stem-LUR) is the data and **Matlab** codes repository for one of my papers entitled "Concurrent spatiotemporal daily land use regression modeling and missing data imputation of fine particulate matter using distributed space-time expectation maximization" which is appeared in the [Atmospheric Environment journal (IF = 4.012)](http://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2019.117202).

## Assistive technologies

- [Dual Voice for NVDA](https://mahmood-taghavi.github.io/dual_voice/) is an open source software developed in **Python** programming language which adds support for multilingual speech to a famous screen reader software namely NVDA (screen readers are software which let blind and visually impaired users to interact with their computers).
- [SAPI_Unifier](https://mahmood-taghavi.github.io/SAPI_Unifier/) is an open source software developed in **C# dot Net** to Unify installed Microsoft OneCore voices and Microsoft Speech Server voices with Microsoft Speech API version 5 (SAPI 5) in Windows. So visually impaired users can use and enjoy all of them as standard SAPI 5 voices.  
- [eSpeakPlus](https://mahmood-taghavi.github.io/eSpeakPlus/) is a collection of espeak Text To Speech (TTS) engine for Windows, Mbrola speech synthesis library, some of Mbrola voices (ir1; de6; de7; en1; us1; us2; us3), and the NVDA defined voice variants including the famous "max". This suite supports Persian and other languages and has the standard SAPI 5 speech driver. It also contains **phonetic translation** files for two Mbrola diphone voices namely de6 and de7 which make enable espeak TTS to read Persian and English text using the aforementioned German voices.
