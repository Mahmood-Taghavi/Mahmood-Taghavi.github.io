I am a biostatistician with interests in statistics, epidemiology, and computer science. You can see my scientific publications and reviews in [my Publons profile](https://publons.com/researcher/1553453/seyed-mahmood-taghavi-shahri/) and if interested follow [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahmood-taghavi-03836940/). 
So, this page is dedicated to my programming projects (scientific and also assistive technologies that I developed in my spare time).

## Scientific projects

  - A package for Ridit Analysis in R statistical environment. This repository entitled [Ridit](https://github.com/Mahmood-Taghavi/Ridit). It is also available from CRAN (The Comprehensive R Archive Network). 
  - Companion repository for one of my papers entitled "Concurrent spatiotemporal daily land use regression modeling and missing data imputation of fine particulate matter using distributed space-time expectation maximization" which is appeared in the Atmospheric Environment journal. This repository contains data and Matlab codes and is entitled [d-stem-LUR](https://github.com/Mahmood-Taghavi/d-stem-LUR). 

## Assistive technologies

- [Dual Voice for NVDA](https://mahmood-taghavi.github.io/dual_voice/) is a project developed in Python programming language which adds support for multilingual speech to a famous assistive technology namely NVDA. 
- [eSpeakPlus](https://mahmood-taghavi.github.io/eSpeakPlus/) is a collection of espeak Text To Speech (TTS) engine for Windows, Mbrola library, some Mbrola voices (ir1; de6; de7; en1; us1; us2; us3), and the NVDA defined voice variants including the famous "Max". This suite supports Persian and other languages and has the standard SAPI 5 speech driver. It also contains phonetic translation files for two Mbrola diphone databases namely de6 and de7 which enable espeak to read Persian and English text using the aforementioned German diphones. 
- [SAPI_Unifier](https://mahmood-taghavi.github.io/SAPI_Unifier/) is a free tool developed in Visual C# to Unify installed Microsoft OneCore voices and Microsoft Speech Server voices with Microsoft Speech API version 5 (SAPI 5) in Windows. So visually impaired users can use and enjoy them as standard SAPI 5 voices.
